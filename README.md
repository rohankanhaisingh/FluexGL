# 🚀 FluexGL

A graphical library created by Rohan Kanhaisingh under the name *Fluex*.
Built with modern technologies such as **WebGPU** and powerful mathematical tools, FluexGL provides developers with everything they need to create stunning websites, games, and other graphics.

## ⚔️ About
FluexGL is a TypeScript-based library that uses WebGPU to render beautiful graphics.
The goal is to build complex scenes with minimal code and logic. Everything comes built-in and evolves over time.

This library can be seen as a superset of **Stinky2D**, another graphics library by Rohan Kanhaisingh.
The main difference is that FluexGL uses **WebGPU** instead of Canvas2D.

## 📦 Installation

## 🧩 Utilities

FluexGL includes powerful built-in utilities that integrate with the rendering pipeline:
